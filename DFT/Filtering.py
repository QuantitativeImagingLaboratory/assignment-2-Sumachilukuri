        You are allowed to used inbuilt functions to compute fft
        There are packages available in numpy as well as in opencv
        Steps:
        1. Compute the fft of the image
        2. shift the fft to center the low frequencies
        3. get the mask (write your code in functions provided above) the functions can be called by self.filter(shape, cutoff, order)
        4. filter the image frequency based on the mask (Convolution theorem)
        5. compute the inverse shift
        6. compute the inverse fourier transform
        7. compute the magnitude
        8. You will need to do a full contrast stretch on the magnitude and depending on the algorithm you may also need to
        take negative of the image to be able to view it (use post_process_image to write this code)
        Note: You do not have to do zero padding as discussed in class, the inbuilt functions takes care of that
